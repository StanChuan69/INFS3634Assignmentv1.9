1. Youtube videos were self created and uploaded. They were then embedded into the app using Youtube APIs
2. The code for the QuizActivity and StartingScreenActivity activities as well as the QuizDbHelper, Question, and QuizContract classes were adapted from this source: https://codinginflow.com/tutorials/android/quiz-app-with-sqlite/part-5-quiz-activity. Modifications and additions were made to the code such as adding additional questions and adding feedback mechanisms through an additional 'explanation' string and toasts to display them for dynamic user feedback.
